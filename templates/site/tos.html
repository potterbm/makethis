				<h1>Legal Stuff</h1>
				<p>This is a nice list of all the things you can and can&rsquo;t do. If it&rsquo;s not on this list, we probably don&rsquo;t care whether or not you do it. Either that or we forgot to make a rule about it. If that happens, we reserve the right to name the new rule after you.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>You can&rsquo;t sue us for any reason, ever.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>All work must be licensed under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL</a>, or a similarly permissive license. We don&rsquo;t love viral licenses because they're pretty restrictive and it makes the huge international conglomerates that fund us sad.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Don&rsquo;t be a dick to other people on our site. Keep your dickery where it belongs: in mean-spirited YouTube comments that no one will ever read.</p>

				<h1>Common Questions</h1>
				<p>We made a list of questions that you might be asking if you&rsquo;re one of those people who like to try to break the spirit of rules without technically breaking the actual rules. While we agree that technically correct is the best kind of correct, try to be more original than this.</p>

				<h2>Can I make sure no one else uses my work?</h2>
				<p>No. The entire point of this site is to show people your work. That is not <strong>literally</strong> the dumbest question we&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>

				<hr class="large spacer small-keyline" />

				<h2>Can I make money from this site?</h2>
				<p>Sort of. All the work on this site is licensed under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL</a> (or another permissive license), so you can do whatever you want with it. If that involves selling it, then yes, you can make money. We're not going to pay you anything, though.</p>

				<hr class="large spacer small-keyline" />

				<h2>Is it okay to repost someone else&rsquo;s work?</h2>
				<p>Of course not, you walnut. If you didn&rsquo;t make it or contribute in some way, why would you even think about doing that?</p>

				<hr class="large spacer small-keyline" />

				<h2>But what if I really want people to like me?</h2>
				<p>We aren't really in the business of helping you get people to like you. If you really care that much, make something awesome and post it here. That will definitely get people to love you. For sure.</p>

				<hr class="large spacer small-keyline" />

				<h2>Can I get away with being a dick to anyone on this site?</h2>
				<p>No. Unless we don&rsquo;t actually notice. But we&rsquo;ll probably notice, because people tend to complain about getting their feelings hurt on the internet.</p>
